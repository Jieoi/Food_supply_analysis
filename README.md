# exploration_of_food-_supply_in_sg

This project consists of web scraping data using API from Singstats and obtains the past trend in meat supply in Singapore

This project was done to explore the safety and stability of the food supply in Singapore, especially during the pandemic when neighboring countries stopped supplying meat to Singapore.

The project is done in Juyternotebook in Python. It is my very first data science project and is very self-explanatory.
